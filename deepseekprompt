QUANTUM MERIDIAN - MARKET ANALYSIS PHASE

Current Date & Time: [Insert Current UTC Time]

Step 1: Macro & On-Chain Context (The "Why Now?")

Analyze the current macro environment (e.g., DXY strength, Fed policy, S&P 500 trend). Is it risk-on or risk-off?
Summarize key on-chain metrics for BTC and ETH (e.g., Exchange Outflows/Inflows, MVRV Z-Score, Puell Multiple). Are whales accumulating or distributing?
What is the general market sentiment from reliable sources (e.g., Crypto Fear & Greed Index, major news headlines)?
Step 2: Technical Analysis - Multi-Timeframe (The "Where?")
For the specified asset (BTC/ETH/DOGE/SOL), analyze the following timeframes: 4-hour (for trend), 1-day (for context), and 1-week (for major structure).

Trend: What is the primary trend? (Use 50 & 200 EMA on the 1D chart).
Support & Resistance: Identify the 3 most critical support and resistance levels.
Momentum: What is the RSI(14) and MACD indicating on the 1D and 4H charts? Is there any divergence?
Volume: Is volume confirming the current price action?
Step 3: Relative Strength & Correlations (The "Which One?")

Compare the 1-week performance of BTC, ETH, DOGE, and SOL against each other.
Which asset is showing the most relative strength or weakness? Is it leading or lagging the market?
Is the BTC.D (Bitcoin Dominance) trending up or down? What does this imply for alts?
Step 4: Synthesis & Initial Bias
Based on the synthesis of Steps 1-3, formulate a initial, non-binding directional bias (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish) for the overall market and for the specific asset.

Step 5: High-Conviction Signal Generation
Based on the synthesized analysis, answer the following with absolute clarity. A trade must score 7 or higher on the Conviction Score to be eligible for leverage.

Asset: (BTC / ETH / DOGE / SOL)
Direction: (LONG / SHORT)
Conviction Score: (Rate 1 to 10, where 10 is maximum conviction).
Rationale: In 3 bullet points, concisely state the top 3 reasons for this trade.
Entry Zone: Define a precise price zone for entry.
Stop-Loss (SL): Define an exact price level where the thesis is invalidated. This is non-negotiable.
Profit Targets (TP): Define at least two take-profit levels.
TP1: (e.g., 1.5x Risk) - [Price]
TP2: (e.g., 3.0x Risk) - [Price]
Position Sizing & Leverage:
Leverage Allocation Matrix:
Conviction Score 7-8: Use 1.0x to 1.3x Leverage.
Conviction Score 9: Use 1.5x to 1.8x Leverage.
Conviction Score 10: Use 2.0x Leverage (Maximum).
Final Leverage for this trade: [State the exact leverage, e.g., 1.5x]
Risk per Trade: This trade will risk no more than [e.g., 1.5%] of the total portfolio value.
Step 6: Pre-Trade Risk Checklist (Must answer YES to all):

 The trade aligns with the primary trend on the 1D chart.
 The entry zone is at a key support/resistance level with a clear invalidation point.
 The Risk/Reward ratio is a minimum of 1:2.
 There is no major macroeconomic event scheduled within the next 24 hours that could cause a black swan.
 LEVERAGE CHECK: The calculated leverage adheres to the Maximum 2x rule and the Conviction Score Matrix.
FINAL TRADE SIGNAL:
[Asset] | [Direction] | [Entry Zone] | [SL] | [TP1/TP2] | [Leverage: X.XX] | [Conviction Score: X]
